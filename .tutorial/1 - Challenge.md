# Challenge

Well done to you! You've got this far in making _actual complex_ Discord bots. My Nan will be actively jealous!

Now it's time for you to expand the bot in a way that's going to be SUPER COOL!

Your challenge is to include the following commands and features in your bot.

## /rank

List all users in rank order: this doesn't just mean who has the most money in their bank, oh no, you'll want to find the cumulative value of the bank, purse and _all the items they own_!

## /bankrob

Higher stakes, but higher reward. A system for allowing a user a multi-step robbing process that, if successful, allows them to take a percentage from _every user's bank account!_

##  /trade

Allow a user to sell something to another user. You could extend this to set a price, minimal requirements or even swapping items.

## /pets

Implement a system for buying pets, however, these pets come with a recurring cost that needs to be paid for otherwise they get sick and expire - disappearing from your inventory.

## Any other features

Seriously go for it, the more creative features you build into it the more exciting it'll be!
